                        <p> I am originally from Iran. I was born in Isfahan, one of the big and beautiful cities in Iran.I have been here in the  United States  for 8 months.I have been married  since 13 years ago.
                                I immigrated to the United States because I think it is a very good opportunity for my kids to have a better life; however it is very difficult for me because I miss my family especially my mom & dad.
                                I have two  little kids; therefore, I am a busy mom. If I have time  I love to read books , listen to music and walk along the beach.I love cooking and I think I am very good at cooking especially, Persian food.
                                My goal for the future is to see my kids successful,  improve my English and continue my education .</p>
                               <p> I’m a passionate, optimistic & dedicated woman who takes up responsibilities with utmost enthusiasm and see to it that I complete my tasks and assignments in time. I’ve a great amount of perseverance to achieve my goal. My optimistic and planned approach in things I do is what driving me towards my success.

                                As how I strive for perfection in things, I expect the same from others as well. If things go out of control or go way out of track, I go an extra mile and contribute my efforts, in getting things done in time.
                        </p>
